                  <i>Our Secret</i>
            </h1>
            <p class="intro_p">How did we started? Well, we started with a small group of portuguese friends, 
                some unemployed some not, eager to live in this beautiful city with an improved purpose.
                <br>
                <br>We love our city but ALSO multicultural environments and sharing of travelling experiences, cultures and much more.
                <br> In our travels we always felt there was a lack of local information of where to eat, to go, to see as a local. 
                We didn't want to experience as a TOURIST!
                <br>
                <br>That's when we all thought together about opening Local Company For You@ to live as we live in Lisbon. 
                We were all born in this city with the passion to share with you the best local experience. 
                <br>
                <br>Since 2018 sharing a Lisboner life. Join us!</p>
